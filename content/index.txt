## Overview
This project was started because while there are log monitoring solutions and even
a few realtime website analytics products out there I have not found that right
mix of features in an opensource project that scratched all the right places.

There are a few primary use cases for this software, namely:

*  High performance log aggregation from servers, applications and security appliances.
*  Security Event Monitoring and Evaluation
*  Simple website analytics

## System Components
There are three major components of the system.  The collectors which capture and
forward log events, the event sink which processes the data and stores information
in the database and the viewers which display the information.

### Collectors

*  [IIS7 Native Syslog Module](/collectors/nativeiis7.html)
*  Apache Piped Log Relay Module
*  Log4Net UDP Appender Configuration

### Event Sinks

*  Console Testing Sink
*  Event Storage & Processing Windows Service

### Event Viewers

*  .NET MVC3 Website
