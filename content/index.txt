## Overview
This project was started because while there are log monitoring solutions and even
a few realtime website analytics products out there I have not found that right
mix of features in an opensource project that scratched all the right places.

There are a few primary use cases for this software, namely:

*  High performance log aggregation from servers, applications and security appliances.
*  Security Event Monitoring and Evaluation
*  Simple website analytics
